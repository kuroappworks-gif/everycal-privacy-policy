EveryCal (hereinafter referred to as "the App") respects the privacy of its users and is committed to protecting personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how user information is handled within the App.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### 1.1 Information Collected Automatically (Ad Delivery and Usage Analysis)
The App uses the following third-party service providers for ad delivery and to improve quality. These providers may automatically collect information such as device identifiers (e.g., Ad ID), IP addresses, and crash logs to display appropriate advertisements and analyze app usage.

*   **Google AdMob / User Messaging Platform (UMP)**

### 1.2 Information Entered by the User (Local Data)
Data entered when using the App's features (calculation history, memos, checklists, etc.), as well as App settings (floating calculator position, size, opacity, etc.), are stored only on the user's device (local storage). This data is never transmitted to the developer's server or shared with third parties.

### 1.3 Use of External APIs
In the currency conversion feature, requests are sent to external APIs (such as the Frankfurter API) to obtain the latest rates. No personally identifiable information is sent during this communication.

### 1.4 Use of Microphone Feature (Voice Input)
The App requests permission to use the device's microphone (RECORD_AUDIO) for calling calculator cards and entering memos by voice. Voice data is used only for voice recognition processing within the device and is never transmitted or stored on the developer's server or by third parties.

### 1.5 Use of "Display over other apps" Feature
The App utilizes system permissions (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) to display the floating calculator. This feature is used solely for the overlay display of the calculator and does not capture information on the user's screen or monitor other operations.

## 2. Information Sharing and Disclosure
The App does not provide user's personal information to third parties except in the following cases:

*   When the user has given consent
*   When required by law
*   When third-party services (AdMob) integrated into the App collect information for ad delivery or analysis

## 3. Data Deletion
Data entered by the user (history, memos, etc.) is stored within the device. These data are completely deleted by uninstalling the App or by selecting "Clear Data" or "Clear Storage" in the device's App settings.
